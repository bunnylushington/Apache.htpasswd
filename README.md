========

Provides basic htpasswd(1) functions as a library.  The hashing
methods available are :md5 (the default), :sha, :crypt, and
:plaintext.

    # Examples
    iex> Apache.Htpasswd.check "user:pass", "test/htfile"
    false
  
    iex> Apache.Htpasswd.check "plaintext:plaintext", "test/htfile"
    true
  
    iex> Apache.Htpasswd.encode "user", "pass"
    "user:$apr1$O5f9TZT.$IBzxX8byvgfsLYp/dkIzC/"
  
    iex> Apache.Htpasswd.encode "user", "pass", :sha
    "user:{SHA}nU4eI71bcnBGqeO0t9tXvY1u5oQ="
  
    iex> Apache.Htpasswd.check "user:pass", Apache.Htpasswd.encode("user", "pass")
    true  
  
    iex> Apache.Htpasswd.add("user", "pass", "/tmp/htpasswd")
    {:ok, "user:$apr1$on6He14N$3AeecTsC32uTadbYK1Ij4/"}
  
    iex> Apache.Htpasswd.rm("user", "/tmp/htpasswd")
